# flutDot

Welcome to the **flutDot** project! This project aims to provide simple, easy-to-follow examples for leveraging hardware devices and common software solutions using Flutter. Each example is designed as an own application and to be as straightforward as possible, helping you grasp the concepts quickly and effectively.

Some of these applications may also be available on popular app platforms, including the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Microsoft Store.
